 * the input + 1.
 * 4- default constructor that sets num to 0
 * 5- constructor that sets num to specific number, if the number is odd then increase by one.
 * 6- method print to display the number
 * 7. method add that accepts an integer and adds the int to num (if the result is odd then add one).
 * 8. same for subtract.
 * 9. print to show num.
